# Cardiovascular Healthcare Analysis- with Machine Learning

# Description

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner. The data below has the information about the factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. 
# Task to be performed:
1. Preliminary analysis:
○ Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings on the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
○ Based on these findings,remove duplicates(if any) and treatmissing values using an appropriate strategy
2. Prepare a report about the data explaining the distribution of thedisease and the related factors using the steps listed below:
○ Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data and explore themeasures of central tendencies and spread of the data
○ Identify the data variables which are categorical and describe and explore these variables using the appropriate tools, such as countplot
○ Study the occurrence of CVD across the Age category
○ Study the composition of all patients with respect to the Sex category
○ Study if one can detect heartattacks based on anomalies in the resting blood pressure (trestbps) of a patient
○ Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and a target variable
○ State what relationship exists between peakexercising and the occurrence of a heart attack
○ Check if thalassemia is a majorcause of CVD
○ List how the other factors determine the occurrence of CVD
○ Use a pair plot to understand the relationship between all the given variables
3. Build a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using a logistic regression and random forest and explore the results while using correlation analysis and logistic regression (leveraging standard error and p-values from statsmodels) for feature selection.
